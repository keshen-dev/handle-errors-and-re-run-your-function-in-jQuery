# handle-errors-and-re-run-your-function-in-jQuery

You can use a try-catch block to handle errors and re-run your function in jQuery. Here's an example:

```
function myFunction() {
  try {
    // Your code here
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error occurred: " + error);
    myFunction(); // Call the function again if an error occurs
  }
}
```
In this example, if an error occurs in the try block, it will be caught and logged to the console. Then the function will be called again using myFunction().

Alternatively, you can use the setTimeout() function to delay the re-running of your function:

```
function myFunction() {
  // Your code here
  setTimeout(function() {
    myFunction(); // Call the function again after a delay
  }, 1000); // Set the delay time in milliseconds
}
```
In this example, the myFunction() is called again after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). You can adjust the delay time as needed.
